      <p className='p1'> I began my higher education at Gainesville State College where I earned an A.A. in Anthropology. I met an amazing, inspirational mentor and life-long friend who introduced me to my first love: Archaeology.
        <br/> <br/> After transferring to UGA, I completed my B.A in Anthropology with a minor in Geology and a certificate in Archaeology. It was official. I was an "ologist". I spent the next decade digging in the dirt, just as nature intended.

And now I'm here, with a new passion, a new direction, and something to look forward to every day. </p>
